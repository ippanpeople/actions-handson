#  Introduction to GitHub Actions
This repository provides a hands-on introduction to GitHub Actions, focusing on deploying a Go application to Sakura's AppRun service. The steps are designed to guide you through forking the repository, setting up GitHub Actions, and deploying your application.

## What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to create CI/CD workflows for your GitHub projects. It enables you to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code directly from your GitHub repository.

## GitHub Actions Common Terms
| Term       | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **actions** | Reusable units of code (like plugins) that perform specific tasks in a workflow. |
| **Workflow** | A configurable automation process defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml`. It includes triggers, jobs, and steps. |
| **Trigger** | An event that starts a workflow, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or manual dispatch. |
| **Jobs**     | A collection of steps that run in the same runner environment (like a VM). Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially. |
| **Steps**    | Individual tasks inside a job. A step can run a command or call an action. |
| **Secrets**  | Encrypted environment variables used to store sensitive information like API tokens. |
| **Environment Variables** | Variables you define to reuse values across steps or jobs. Can be set globally or locally. |
| **Runners**  | The virtual machines or containers that run the jobs. GitHub provides hosted runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`). |
| **Matrix**   | A feature that lets you run a job with multiple combinations of parameters (e.g., different OS versions or Node.js versions). |
| **Artifacts** | Files generated by a workflow (e.g., build outputs) that can be stored or shared between jobs. |
| **Reusable Workflows** | Workflows that can be called from other workflows to promote reuse and maintainability. |
| **Composite Actions** | Custom actions made up of multiple shell steps, written in YAML. Useful for bundling common logic. |
